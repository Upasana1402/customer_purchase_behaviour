# customer_purchase_behaviour
## Project overview

This project replicates a real-world, end-to-end corporate data analytics workflow, turning raw data into actionable business insights. It demonstrates the ability to clean, analyse, and visualize data to support strategic data-driven decision-making and recommendations.
The project covers the full analytics lifecycle:
•	Data Preparation, Modelling & EDA (Python): performed data cleaning, transformation, and exploring the dataset to ensure quality and reliability.
•	Data Analysis (SQL):  Simulated business scenarios and queried data to uncover insights on customer segments, loyalty, and purchasing patterns.
•	Visualization & Insights (Power BI): Designed an interactive dashboard to communicate key metrics and trends.
•	Reporting & Presentation:  Delivered insights and actionable business recommendations based on data findings.

## Dataset Information
•	The dataset contains 3,900 rows and 18 columns.
         Key Features:
•	Customer Demographics: Age, gender, location, and subscription status
•	Purchase Details: Items purchased, category, purchase amount, size, and color
•	Shopping Behaviour: Discount usage, promo codes, past purchases, purchase frequency, review ratings, and shipping type
Missing Data:
•	37 missing values in the Review Rating column
Tools
•	Pandas ,  SQL, Power BI

## Methodology
**1.Exploratory data analysis using Python-Pandas:**
Started the project with data cleaning and preparation in Python to make the dataset reliable for analysis.
-Data Loading: Loaded the dataset using pandas.
-Initial Exploration: Reviewed dataset structure with df.info()  to check the structure and generated summary statistics using `df.describe()`.  
-Handling Missing values: Checked for null values using df.isna().sum() and imputed 37 missing entries in the Review rating column using the median rating of each product category.
-Column Standardisation: Renamed columns to snake case for consistency and improve readability and documentation.
-Feature Engineering:
Created an ‘age_group’ column by binning customer ages.
Derived a ‘purchase_frequency_days’ column from purchase data.
-Data Validation: Compared ‘discount_applied’ and ‘promo_code_used’ to check duplicates; dropped ‘promo_code_used’- redundant column.
-Database Integration: Connected Python script to PostgreSQL and loaded the cleaned dataset into the database for SQL analysis.

**2.Data analysis using SQL:**
Conducted structured analysis in PostgreSQL to answer key business questions.
1.	Revenue by Gender- Compared total revenue generated by male vs. female customers.
2.	High-Spending Discount Users-Identified customers who used discounts yet spent above the average purchase amount.
3.	Top 5 Products by Rating- Found best reviewed products with the highest average review ratings.
4.	Shipping Type Comparison- Compared average purchase amounts between standard and express shipping.
5.	Subscribers vs. Non-Subscribers- Analysed differences in average spend and total revenue across subscription status.
6.	Discount-dependent Products- Identified 5 products that rely heavily on discounts to sell.
7.	Customer segmentation- Split customers into new, returning and loyal segments based on purchase history.
8.	Top 3 products per category- Listed the most purchased products within each category.
9.	Repeat buyers and Subscriptions- Evaluated whether customers with >5 purchases are more likely to subscribe.
10.	Revenue by Age group- Calculated total revenue contribution of each age group.

**3.Visualization on Power BI- Dashboard:**
Built an interactive dashboard in Power BI to visually present key-insights and trends from the data.
